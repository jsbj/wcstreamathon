	<p class="pb-0 text-lg" style="color: white;">The NSF <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/intent-restructure-critical-weather-science-infrastructure">has announced</a> its plans to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/12/16/trump-dismantle-national-center-atmospheric-research-climate/87798771007/">dismantle</a> the National Center for Atmospheric Center, a crown jewel of American science that <a href="https://researchworks.ucar.edu/">deeply benefits our country and the world</a>. We want to inform the American public why their lab is worth protecting by making a short video featuring AGU scientists:</p>
	<h2>12:15pm - Group Photo/Video</h2>
	<p class="pb-0 text-lg" style="color: white;">We want to get as many AGU participants as possible to join us to show our love for NCAR. We'll meet at <b>the "science strong" wall across from the Plenary Hall</b> at the entrance to the convention center.</p>

	<h2>1pm - AGU Town Hall</h2>
	<p class="pb-0 text-lg" style="color: white;">AGU hosts a Town Hall with UCAR president Antonio Busalacchi, <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/agu25/meetingapp.cgi/Session/278500">What We Stand to Lose: Protecting NSF NCAR</a> in <b>La Nouvelle C.</b></p>

	<h2>1:30pm to 5:30pm - Interviews</h2>
	<p class="pb-0 text-lg" style="color: white;">Come share why NCAR is important for your science in a short video interview. Come to <b>PJs Coffee on the first floor in front of Hall C</b> and look for the person with the "We ❤️ NCAR" sign, and we will interview as many people as we can.</p>
