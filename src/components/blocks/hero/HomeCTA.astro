			<p class="pb-0 text-lg" style="color: white;">Wed. May 28th 1pm ET/10am PT to Sun. June 1st 5:30pm ET/2:30pm PT on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@wclivestream">YouTube:</a></p>
			<h1>üíØ HOURS TO SAVE AMERICA'S FORECASTS</h1>
			<p class="pb-0 text-lg" style="color: white;">Whether it's tomorrow's temperatures or the sea level in fifty years, Americans need to plan for our futures. For generations, the US government has invested in <a href="/learn">the science that helps us do so</a>, building one of the greatest meteorology and climate science communities in the world. </p>
			<!-- Along the way, we <a href="https://www.vos.noaa.gov/MWL/dec_07/weatherprediction.shtml">invented computerized weather forecasts</a> and <a href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/awards/former-noaa-scientist-suki-manabe-shares-nobel-prize-in-physics-for-pioneering-climate-prediction/">modern-day climate modeling</a>, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/trump-cuts-target-world-leading-greenhouse-gas-observatory-hawaii-2025-03-11/">first documented the increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub></a>. -->
			<p class="pb-0 text-lg" style="color: white;">In recent months, this community have been thwarted in our mission of serving the public due to <a href="/cuts">substantial cuts and firings</a>. These actions have <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/meteorologists-say-nws-cuts-degraded-forecasts-recent-storms-rcna202386">already hurt our forecasts</a>, endangering Americans as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/weather/nws-forecasting-layoffs-trump">hurricane season approaches</a>. Legally required assessments of the climate <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-climate-assessment-report-scientists-fired/">are being stopped</a>, and far more drastic cuts are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/climate/trump-noaa-budget-cuts">being proposed</a>.</p>

			<p class="pb-0 text-lg" style="color: white;"><b>But it's not too late to stop these cuts.</b> Already, public pressure has helped to <a href="https://www.theassemblync.com/environment/noaa-weather-center-chapel-hill-funding-trump/">reopen shuttered weather data centers</a>. To help keep this pressure building, meteorologists and climate scientists from across America want to fulfill our mission by sharing our science with you - so we're coming to your screens, speaking and answering your questions, for over 100 hours, in this science-filled, non-partisan event:</p>
			<h3>The Weather & Climate Livestream</h3>
				
			<p class="pb-0 text-lg" style="color: white;">
				From Wednesday, May 28th to Sunday, June 1st, join meteorologists and climate scientists from across the US as we share our work, and show you what makes it so vital. We will clarify the impact of the cuts on this research, and answer your questions about weather and climate research in the US. Information on how to watch is coming soon. If you are a scientist who wants to participate, please visit this <a href="/speakers">speakers</a> page to learn more.</p>
